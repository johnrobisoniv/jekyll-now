I don't want to appear conceited so I rarely talk about my accomplishments. I don't know if this is the most effective - it appears to prompt self doubt and perhaps repress self esteem. There is much I've done in my life I'm proud of, but it would not be right to talk about that without first mentioning the enormous privilege, advantage, luck and good fortune I have experienced in my life, that is the basis of my life. My family, friends, teachers, bosses, peers - other humans (primarily) who have all poured so much effort into me becoming me ... I hope they did it because they suspected that if I were to develop myself to the fullest extent I could contribute in some lasting way to the good and beauty and truth of the world. It is because of these uncontrollable attributes of my upbringing - to present - that are probably the entire, or the main, reason I am in the position I am, to speak of my accomplishments - the things I'm proud that I've done.
