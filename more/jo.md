i think you might owe me an apology, but I know I certainly owe you one. I am so sorry Jo, for the way I handled my departure from Backroads. You and Fletch got it right - i have experienced momentarily lapses in judgment every once in a while that can have fairly significant negative consequences ... Sometimes those moments last a few hours, explaining why I posted the glassdoor review I did. Looking back at our formal farewell emails, I think this may have been the primary mistake.

I was disappointed that you didn't call. I know it was low to write about it publicly, but I was being honest - that is why I chose not to take it down. I would have much rather asked you that in person, on the phone, and gotten your answer directly ... but no matter, it was inappropriate. A misjudgment. And about someone I care quite deeply about - you.

I do feel I'm getting better - since we last spoke I have realized a few things, and have chosen to engage with my life. Taking responsibility for my actions, and the impact of those actions - asking whether or not I would be more like my vision of my ideal self if I did this right now. I still certainly slip up, though fortunately not too gravely (working a desk job is a lot lower pressure - lower expectations for timely execution than at Backroads).
