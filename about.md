I am a data and digital product designer studying for a masters in Spatial Data Science and Visualisation at University College London. I am interested in how emerging technologies can improve issues of human dignity and planetary stewardship with a focus on the ethics of privacy and security, disrupting drivers of intentional human violence, and promoting conscious consumerism and the transition to a circular economy. Building on my professional experience in tech entrepreneurship and civil society, my work is oriented towards identifying and scaling innovative digital solutions with social and environmental impact.
