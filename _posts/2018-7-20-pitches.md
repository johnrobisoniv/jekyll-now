A few brief pitches related to my research interests.
First, guiding principles, insights and assumptions:

1. People should be able to do what they want provided they are not harming others.
2. Most violence is perpetrated by people who are incentivized to rather than people who harm for the sake of harming.
3. Leverage points exist in the global system that could allow for efficient impact in the disruption of drivers of intentional human violence.
4. Focus on the root of the problem rather than the branches - focus energies as far upstream as possible. I suspect that power is concentrated into the hands of a relative few who are _highly_ incentivized to continue operations and maintain the status quo.

## The Future of Maritime

### Maritime Cybersecurity - State of the industry

As the global maritime transport industry's reliance on information systems grows, new threats to operations are emerging.
- Types of threats and how they work
- Players in the industry, especially consultants and contractors
- Risks and scale of risk - what are potential costs?

Case Studies:
- Petya attack on AP Moller Maersk
- [Port of Antwerp](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-24539417)

### Disruptive Tech in Navigation, Location and Supply Chain Logistics

Review critical digital and communication systems on commercial vessels and the role they play. Outline why they are critical and what shortcomings exist. Explore emerging technologies and the potential they represent to address these shortcomings. Analyze potential implications of adoption of new technologies - costs, risks, benefits and barriers to adoption.

- Location services
- Asset tracking
- IoT

### Maritime domain awareness and sanctions violation

How do sanctions violators operate and how might they be disrupted? Can remote data mining methods provide information necessary to identify likely violators? What are leverage points in the system that could prevent their illicit activity?

## The global drugs problem

The problem is policy more than anything.

## Conscious Consumerism

Many of the ills of capitalism are perpetuated by undiscerning or unscrupulous consumption habits - there is little incentive or pressure to consider anything beyond price in purchasing a product. This incentivizes producers to bring products to market as cheaply as possible. Unethical actors are willing to violate ethics or, worse, to break laws related to human dignity and environmental sustainability.

Yet a market requires three things: a vendor, a product and a consumer. As consumers' awareness of the global social and environmental impact of the products they purchase grows, how might the adoption of conscious consumer habits be accelerated? How might the burden of decision-making regarding product purchases be eased? Could this behavioral change drive meaningful change in private sector social and environmental harm?


## Benevolent oversight: an open source public surveillance system

What would it entail to develop a system of 'benevolent oversight', leveraging sensors and smart (secret) contract technologies, to surveil public spaces and - perhaps - provide some intervention mechanism if harmful behavior is imminent? What ethical considerations deserve thought, and how might they be addressed? What unintended consequences might arise? How could such a system be used by members of the public to ensure safety and security? How would privacy be respected?


## A reimagination of 'global governance'

Transcending the traditional conception of geographic governance units, is an enforceable governance system based on group membership (rather than physical location) feasible?

How might entities voluntarily adopt mechanisms to enforce good behavior, based on the emerging 'decentralized identifier' technologies like Sovrin? How could agents be incentivized to participate, and what would be the potential implications of developing such a system? Ethics? Unintended consequences?


## A potential collective rule-making system

Policymaking and politics must evolve if they are to retain relevance into the 21st century. Humans could benefit from a flexible, adaptable, location-based and collective system to propose and agree upon rules and norms.

Who would be entitled to contribute to rule-making in a particular space?
What would the rule making mechanism be?
How could rule compliance be enforced or incentivized? How could non-compliance be penalized?
Could consensus-driven solution generation be effective? When and when not? How would disputes be resolved?

## Question

To what extent should authority reside at the lowest level?
