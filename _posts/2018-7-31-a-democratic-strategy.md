A cheeky strategy proposal / concept note, perhaps for the Democrats in the 2018 and 2020 US elections

One of two ways



Drive left, elect Sanders or Warren (?) or something, leave the middle open for one of a number of parties that will form (moderate, right and left), leave it as a coin toss on who ends up with the most / however the election is decided with a hung electorate.

Or, select a moderate centrist Dem as presidential candidate and run on a 'return to normal' line - probably not so good. Normal isn't working.

Or select a leftist presidential candidate and a reformed Republican as VP running mate. (Sanders / Flake, Kasich or Haley?)
